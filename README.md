# typst-thesis-enviroment

This repository contains a thesis-template. It includes a simple module for the title page and a custom citation-style that is heavily inspired by the ieee-style.
There is also a GitHub Workflow that automatically compiles the thesis and uploads the pdf as an artifact.
When a tag is pushed, the workflow will also create a release and upload the pdf as a release-asset.

A pre-commit configuration for automatic typst-code-formatting is also included.
